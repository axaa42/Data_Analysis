This project will look to analyse and visualise the majors of women to men since 1970.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

It will show interesting patterns such as which majors have more women or man since 1970.

One of the intresting observations we can see is that in Biologhy and Psycologhy, it shows that women overtake men in these majors over the years. We can also see that men dominate the engineering majors. 

I hope you can look at the plots and make your own observations
