This project will look to analyse and visualise degrees awarded to women and men since 1970.

It will show interesting patterns such as which degrees have more women or man since 1970.

One of the intresting observations we can see is that in Biologhy and Psycologhy, it shows that women overtake men in these subjects over the years.



Dataset=The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category. Randal Olson has made it available on his personal website.
