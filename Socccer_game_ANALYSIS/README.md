In this project we have demonstrated different statistic techniques on a Football game.

Please Note if you want to run this code in your own Computer. Make sure you have downloaded the right packages(preferably Anaconda) otherwise it will not run. I have also used pictures such as Boxplots, Histograms which can be accessed this way aswell.

You can also uncomment certain code which has been commeneted just for educational purposes

-----------------------------------------------------

(REAL) STREATIFIED SAMPLING.py - This project will show how to take a sample by using a techinque called stratefied sampling which removes bias from sample by taking equal proportion of each type.

We learn the following from this program

-that our stratfied representiaon is very accruate agasint the average.

-This also shows that stratfeid sampling will give you the most accruate represnetation of a population

-----------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTIONS.PY- This program shows how to find the distribution of my dataset. You will also see how spot outliers and remove them.

---------------------------------------------------

FIFA.PY- In this program we will find out whether being at a certain age has an effect on the amount of sprint speed given. Statistical demsonstations will be shown in the code

Please note there is Fifanalaysis2. Do not use this. Use the above which is the same.
Fifaanalysis2 was used for debugging

-----------------------------------------------------

OutlierFuniction.py- This is a function we have made to remove outliers from a dataset.

-----------------------------------------------------

Probalility.py- This program shows simple conditonal probality 

-------------------------------------------------------


weightedMEAN_median_mode.py- This program shows statistical tecnniques such as weighted mean, mode,median, z-scores, outlier impact.
